/**
 Abstract superclass for router that can perform route and remove route.
 @discussion
 ## Features:
 
 1. Prepare module with protocol in block, instead of directly configuring the destination or in delegate method (in -prepareForSegue:sender: you have to distinguish different destinations).
 
 2. Specify a router with generic and protocol, then you can hide subclass but still can get routers with different functions.
 
 See sample code in ZIKServiceRouter and ZIKViewRouter for more detail.
 
 @note
 The router only keep weak reference to the destination, the performer is responsible for holding it.
